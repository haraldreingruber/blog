**- Week 4 of my Remote Pair-Programming Tour -**

[Johnicolas][johnicolas] invited me to pair with him after reaching out to developers in the `#PairWithMe` channel on the [Software Crafters Slack][software-crafters-slack-web] workspace.
He works in the infrastructure team at [Glitch][glitch-web] and is an enthusiastic software crafter and [Test-driven development (TDD)][tdd-wiki] practitioner.

[Glitch][glitch-web] is the name and a product of former Fog Creek Software, who invented [Trello][trello-web] and co-created [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow-web], tools which every developers know and probably use everyday. You can imagine it as a Google Docs for developers, or as [JSFiddle][jsfiddle-web] for (also) back-end ([Node.js][node-web]) code. The live-editing and auto-deployment features are remarkable, and for getting started you don't even need an account for getting started. Just play around and carry-on your projects later if you like it.
