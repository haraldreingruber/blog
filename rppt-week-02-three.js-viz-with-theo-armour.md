**- Week 2 of my Remote Pair-Programming Tour -**

[Theo][theo-armour-twitter] found out about my tour from my outreach email campaign and liked the idea from the beginning. He was even offering to cover my accommodation costs in San Francisco, but due to [COVID-19][covid-19-wiki] I had to return to Austria before I was able to start my tour. Thankfully, Theo was still interested in continuing the collaboration and knowledge exchange online and I was happy to find out how he was using [three.js][threejs-web] for his various projects.

## Shared passion for 3D visualization and three.js
Theo is working on some really interesting projects, all [FOSS][foss-wiki] and based on [three.js][threejs-web].

He is really passionate about how "easy" and fast you are able to visualize 3D content in the browser using [three.js][threejs-web], and his excitement is justified and very contagious. Collaborating on [three.js][threejs-web] projects was an awesome tour stop offer for me, and I enjoyed a lot figuring out how I can support Theo on his tasks and brainstorm with him about his future visions.

## Interesting projects Theo is working on
Theo likes to play around with vanilla JavaScript and [three.js][threejs-web]. He has an uncountable number of projects and repositories on Github, which he created while experimenting with the reimagination of visualizing things (objects or information) in 3D.

### Spider gbXML Viewer
One very remarkable project is the [gbXML][gbxml-web] viewer, which allows to view building data stored in Building Information Models (BIM). Check out this online demo of the [Spider gbXML Viewer][spider-gbxml-viewer], I especially like the exploded view and the possibility to toggle the view between interior/exterior surfaces which can be found in the popup menu on the right.

### COVID-19 Viz3D
A couple of weeks ago, with the start of the [COVID-19][covid-19-wiki] pandemic, Theo started a project to visualize the global statistics on a 3D globe in the browser, fetching data from the John Hopkins University and Wikipedia. Here is the [COVID-19 Viz3D][spider-covid-19-viz], which is also static HTML with plain vanilla JavaScript, only depending on [three.js][threejs-web] and fully running in the browser for desktop and mobile devices.

### three.js cookbooks
There are hundreds of HTML and JavaScript snippets, which Theo published in this Cookbooks, like [this one][jaanga-threejs-cookbook]. The idea is to have browser-ready online demos, where also people new to JavaScript and programming in general are able to copy, paste and adapt the code snippets from the [github repository][jaanga-threejs-cookbook].

## Time zone difference and common working hours
<span style="color: red;">TODO!</span>
*Note: was thinking about writing about trying out different schedules for our sessions, but maybe not that interesting and better keeping the article short*

## Topics Theo and I were collaborating on
After Theo showed me what he was working on, we figured out which topics might be interesting to start working on and kicked off our collaboration.

### ESlint
The knew already that there is value in using tools for auto-formatting your code and static code analysis, but ESLint has ...
