**- Week 2 of my Remote Pair-Programming Tour -**

[Theo][theo-armour-twitter] found out about my tour from my outreach email campaign and liked the idea from the beginning. He was even offering to cover my accommodation costs in San Francisco, but due to [COVID-19][covid-19-wiki] I had to return to Austria before I was able to start my tour. Thankfully, Theo was still interested in continuing the collaboration and knowledge exchange online
