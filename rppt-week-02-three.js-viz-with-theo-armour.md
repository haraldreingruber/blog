**- Week 2 of my Remote Pair-Programming Tour -**

[Theo][theo-armour-twitter] found out about my tour from my outreach email campaign and liked the idea from the beginning. He was even offering to cover my accommodation costs in San Francisco, but due to [COVID-19][covid-19-wiki] I had to return to Austria before I was able to start my tour. Thankfully, Theo was still interested in continuing the collaboration and knowledge exchange online

## Shared passion for 3D visualization and three.js
Theo is working on some really interesting projects, all [FOSS][foss-wiki] and based on [three.js][threejs-web].

He is really passionate about how "easy" and fast you are able to visualize 3D content in the browser using [three.js][threejs-web], and his excitement is very contagious. Collaborating on [three.js][threejs-web] projects was an awesome tour stop offer for me, and I enjoyed a lot figuring out how I can support Theo on his tasks and brainstorm with him about his future visions.
